## Saving updated calendar data into html file
<br /> 
For Internet Explorer app uses execCommand('SaveAs', ,) functionality. So you will see File Dialog like this:

In Chrome and FireFox app uses download functionality. In these browsers usually files are downloaded to default location without showing dialog. To force showing dialog you need to change settings.

On Chrome:
- Go to settings.
- Go to Advance Settings.
- In the Downloads section tick the checkbox "Ask where to save each file before downloading".

On FireFox:
- Go to Menu.
- Choose Options.
- Go to General panel.
- In Downloads section tick the checkbox "Always ask me where to save files".

## Original idea
<br /> 
Idea to write this app came from using paper calendar below. At that time most computer calendars could show only one month at a time.
